Please answer the following questions: 

1. How is the event handling in blink program different from the event handling in the hello_world program?

 The key difference between hello_world's and blink's handling of events is indicated by the functions used to wait for events in the while loop. In hello_world, the function used to wait for an event is "PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT" which will continue running through the while loop if any event is recieved. However, in blink the function used to wait for events is "PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL" which will only continue if the specified event (in this case, the event it will wait for is PROCESS_EVENT_TIMER) is received.

2. Explain why LEDs blink in the pattern that they do in the blink program. 

The blink program uses a bit map as a program counter. Each LED is assign a value that corresponds to one of the bits in the bit map. For example, the red LED has the value of 4 which is the third rightmost bit is a 1 and the rest of the bits are zeroes. Thus, when the counter has a value of 7 the third rightmost bit will be set along with the second and furtherest rightmost bits and the red LED will light up. The general pattern for when the red and green LEDs light up is this: the red LED will light up when the counter is any multiple of 4 and the green LED will light up when the counter is an even number.
